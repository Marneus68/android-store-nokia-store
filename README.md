*This project is a billing provider plugin to [android-store](https://github.com/soomla/android-store). Or at the very least, it tries to be.*

## android-store-android-store

This project is an attempt at making a billing service plugin for [android-store](https://github.com/soomla/android-store) that support the Nokia Store for the Nokia X device family. It's not complete yet.  

In order to work with this plugin just see android-store's [Getting Started](https://github.com/soomla/android-store#getting-started). In theory that's how you should use it, however, it's far from being completed.
